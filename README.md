## Phishing Email Analysis: khaleghishop.com

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Analyze a suspicious email to identify phishing indicators using email headers, links, and metadata.


###  Tools Used
- [MXToolbox Header Analyzer](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx)
- Manual inspection of links and structure
- Screenshot evidence

###  Key Findings
In this analysis, I examined a suspicious email to identify phishing indicators. I inspected the email header using MXToolbox, which revealed failures in DMARC, DKIM, and SPF alignmentâ€”common signs of spoofing. The email body contained mismatched URLs, suspicious login links, and unusual sender information. Based on these findings, I concluded that the email is a phishing attempt designed to steal credentials or personal information.
