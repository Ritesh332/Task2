[View Analysis Report](Analysis-Report.md)
In this analysis, I examined a suspicious email to identify phishing indicators. I inspected the email header using MXToolbox, which revealed failures in DMARC, DKIM, and SPF alignment‚Äîcommon signs of spoofing. The email body contained mismatched URLs, suspicious login links, and unusual sender information. Based on these findings, I concluded that the email is a phishing attempt designed to steal credentials or personal information.
